This topic shares a script development tool based on QScintilla+PyQt5 for RobotFramework. It supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, custom icons, etc. Through this sharing, listeners can learn how to write syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error prompts etc. based on QScintilla, and you can customize the IDE for the DSL field.",

The traditional developing method and the isolation of plenty of technical fields decreased the efficiency of IoT projects implementation.<br />This topic will introduce a hands-on IoT project to show the technical details from the device layer to the cloud layer. The hands-on IoT project consists of the MCU end device, embed Linux gateway and server software, almost all the components are developed by only one programming language which is Python. With the help of simplicity and abundant libraries of Python, it\u2019s easy for engineers to construct IoT products quickly and smoothly.",

In Python, overwriting all the code is a big headache. But what if you only need one command to make Python use old language code?<br />This subject(c2py) provides a solution for C/C++: in most cases, only one or two commands are needed to generate pyd that Python can call directly(or source code for pyd). And it can also automatically generate the type information(pyi file) of all generated Python objects.<br />Currently, C++ objects that can automatically encapsulated include enum,class/struct/union, function, namespace, typedef/using, #define(only partially recognizable constants), vareables.<br />Project Address: https://github.com/nanoric/c2py",

The Traditional debug methods have many shortcomings, and some new libraries have inspired us recently. In fact, Python debug can be more intelligent. Intelligent debug refers to the user setting the target variable, and the debug tool automatically tracing the change process of the target variable according to the program execution process. Thereby we can eliminate the trouble of manually stepping through the tools such as pdb and PyCharm. Based on this idea, I will propose a new debug method and tool (also the project I have been working on recently).",

This tutorial is especially useful for people who want to do something personal, but don't know what to do or how to do.<br />After the tutorial, participants will be familiar with the Python package structure. Learn how to write setup.py, how to create a command line program, and how to publish your own Python library.<br />This tutorial will use an example to analyze the birth, creation, release, improvement, and perfection of a project.<br />SCHEDULE<br />1. Analyze requirements. The author uses Python to create an e-book generation tool as an example to analyze what to do, why to do the project, and how to implement it.<br />2. Preparatory work. Understand the format of the e-book, and how to analyze the format of the e-book, and what kinds of methods is available.<br />3. Create project and look for a third-party library that you need to use. Here we will use requests, beautifulsoup, Jinja. We will analyze why these libraries are used and why they are found.<br />4. Familiar with third-party libraries. Understand the basic usage of these dependencies.<br />5. Write the project. Creating a book as an example at first, then writing the basic functions. The participants will learn about this: HTTP requests (requests), web page parsing (beautifulsoup), template engine (Jinja).<br />6. Improve the project. Analyze different web page structures and improve the packaging of your own code, in order to facilitate extension later.<br />7. Publish the project. Complete the editing of the command line, understand the packaging of Python, write the setup.py, and learn about various publishing tools.<br />8. Improve the project. Learning how to expand the project, how to write test cases, and how to build a plug-in system.<br />This tutorial uses a practical example to teach you how to create a Python project from scratch, and this tutorial is suitable for Python beginners and people who interested in e-Books.<br />Level\uff1aBeginner",

This programming language is Python.</p><p>On October 16th, 2000, Python 2.0 was released.</p><p>On December 3rd, 2008, Python 3.0 was released.</p><p>Nowadays, Python has been widely used in service development, operation and maintenance, scientific calculation, theoretical simulation and many other computer fields. More and more people are falling in love with Python and giving back to the Python Community in their own way. Perhaps Guido himself did not realize that the language he created, would be used in so many fields. In a sense, the language he created has almost changed the computer world. </p><p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of Python's birth. We will hold PyCon China 2019 to celebrate the birthday of this great language. The main venue of the conference will be set up in Shanghai, and at the same time, we will also set up sub-venues in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning and so on.</p><p>Whether you are an expert in server development, operation and maintenance, big data, artificial intelligence, or other fields, if you have any experience you want to share with Pythonists, welcome to sign up for our keynotes or lightning talks!</p>",
